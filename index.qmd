## Bicycling in the U.S.

- Bicycling is underutilized with **0.5%** of commuters riding a bicycle (vs. 69.2% commuters driving alone).[@uscb2024commuting]
- **1,166** bicyclists were killed and **49,989** injured in 2023.[@ncsa2025bicyclists]
- Drivers overtaking bicyclists is one of the most dangerous encounters with rear-end collisions accounting for 40% bicyclist fatalities.[@lab2014bicyclist]
- Previous studies on overtaking bicyclists typically used lower resolution sensors (e.g., ultrasonic sensors [@walker2007drivers; @beck2019much] or 2D lidar [@dozza2016drivers]), offering limited insights.

## High resolution 3D lidar{.smaller}

- Lidar (Light Detection and Ranging) is a laser-based sensing technology that captures high-resolution 3D representations of surroundings.
- Lidar enables detailed 3D analysis of vehicle overtaking behavior, capturing precise distances and trajectories that traditional methods miss.
- This study leverages lidar to bridge the gap between technological innovation and safer bicycling environments.

## Study objectives

- Collecting and sharing real-word bicycle riding data using high resolution lidar and cameras.
- Develop an algorithm to automatically detect and track overtaking vehicles based on the lidar point clouds.
- Develop quantitative surrogate safety measures for bicycling safety research.

## Surrogate Safety Measures
- **Passing distance**: the closest distance from the lidar to the car within the passing region
- **Passing duration**: the duration of time that a vehicle spends in the bicycle's passing region

## Surrogate Safety Measures
- **Bicycle speed** estimated using frame-to-frame registration with Iterative Closes Point [@icp] & Random Sample Consensus [@ransac] algorithms.
![](assets/images/icp-diagram.png)

## Surrogate Safety Measures
- **Vehicle Speed**: estimated based on:
  - **bicycle speed** 
  - **relative vehicle speed** estimated using numerical differentiation of vehicle centroid locations across frames:
  𝓿(t) = 𝔁(𝒕) − 𝔁(𝒕 − ∆𝒕) / ∆𝒕 ; with ∆𝒕 = 0.3s
   

## Results

- 306 overtaking events from two trips
- 98 events had valid C3FT readings.
- Passing distance validation: MAE: 3.9 cm, MAPE: 2.5%

## Discussions

- Close passes (<1.5 m) occurred at both low and high speeds, showing risk is not speed-dependent.
- Passing duration revealed exposure over time; longer overtakes often due to congestion or intersections.
- Safe overtaking depends on geometry + speed + traffic context, not any single factor.

## Future work

- Expand data collection across more routes, roadway types, and traffic conditions to improve generalizability.
- Refine methods to improve vehicle detection reliability under bike tilt and curved roadway conditions.
- Analyze vehicle trajectories to better characterize lateral overtaking behavior across diverse environments.
